# ECEN404--Team-49---Drone-Follower
The Drone Follower system will allow a drone to track an object of differing size and speed. The tracking will be done using computer vision, which will then be translated into telemetry for the droneâ€™s flight controller via software in an on-board Raspberry Pi. The tracking system will utilize text detection to identify the desired license plate number, which can then be autonomously trailed by the drone. This video feed and telemetry is then fed to the user. 

This drone follower system has a variety of uses but will be designed with law enforcement and the military in mind for tracking of vehicles.  

The basic capabilities of this system include:    
  -Tracking of an object such as a person or vehicle from altitude    
  -Camera gimbaling to keep the target in-view and produce stabilize feed to the user   
  -Close-quarters tracking of an object through a closed space 
  
Notable drawbacks of this system include:  
  -Speed at which the drone can move to track high-speed targets
